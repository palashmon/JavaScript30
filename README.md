## LOGS

### Day 1: 09 Dec 2017

![Canvas](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1fRlZCWQAAtuMx.jpg)

Found one more useful trick called `console.trace()`. It helps to print a stack trace from the point where the method was called as you can see in this given example below.

### Day 10: 8 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned a user-friendly feature used by popular email clients.

**Tool Found:** [ESLint v3.13.1](http://eslint.org/blog/2017/01/eslint-v3.13.1-released) has been released today. 

### Day 12: 10 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned about key sequence detection & Konami code. Also, found that [BuzzFeed site](https://www.buzzfeed.com/)'s hidden easter egg is still working. To see it in action just press ':arrow_up: :arrow_up: :arrow_down: :arrow_down: :arrow_left: :arrow_right: :arrow_left: :arrow_right: B A'. 

### Day 13: 11 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned a bit more about window events & a very useful javascript debounce function. Today's project helped me to fix an issue related to resize events which was slowing down our site. The goal behind debounce implementation is to reduce overhead by preventing a function from being called several times in succession.

### Day 14: 12 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned more about array & object reference vs actual copy. Found that primitive types are manipulated by value & reference types are manipulated by reference. Numbers and booleans are primitive types in JavaScript -- primitive because they consist of nothing more than a small, fixed number of bytes that are easily manipulated at the low (primitive) levels of the JavaScript interpreter. Objects, on the other hand, are reference types. Arrays and functions, which are specialized types of objects, are therefore also reference types. These data types can contain arbitrary numbers of properties or elements, so they cannot be manipulated as easily as fixed-size primitive values can. Since object and array values can become quite large, it doesn't make sense to manipulate these types by value, as this could involve the inefficient copying and comparing of large amounts of memory.

### Day 15: 13 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned some useful stuff on local Storage & event delegation. 

Completed all of the project goals for today:-

### Day 16: 14 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Today learned about assigning to new variable names using ES6 Object destructuring and how we can update CSS rules like textShadow or anything using javascript. Just like canvas this was a fun challenge today. I tried some css effects like this:-

![Day 16 new taks](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2IFDhkWQAAv-Ck.jpg)

### Day 17: 15 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:**  Updated code to show modified band names on which sort actually happens and on right side the actual band names. After code modifications it looks like this:-

### Day 18: 18 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned more about `Array.prototype.reduce()` and its usability test case scenario. `reduce()` is quite simple & effective in specific scenarios like in the example below:-

![Day 18 new taks](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2eCp-xWgAAbhJz.jpg)

**Tools/Sites Found:** 
 - New, interactive Chrome Dev Tools tutorial: [How to analyze page load performance ⚡️🚀🔎](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/)
 - [2016 JavaScript Rising Stars](https://risingstars2016.js.org/)

### Day 19: 21 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** It was too much fun today. Learned a lot about canvas and pipelining real-time images.

### Day 20: 22 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned about native [SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) interface of the Web Speech API and how we can make use of it. Something like we do in google voice search. I think we can use it in various ways. Only limit is our imagination. Also liked the use npm [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/) for time-saving synchronised browser testing.

### Day 21: 24 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Worked on Device Orientation using Chrome sensors devtools. Also learned about Geolocation & Orientation Api. Unlike desktops, mobile devices commonly use GPS hardware to detect location. [Tweet Link Here 🐦](https://twitter.com/palashv2/status/823919145557299200)

### Day 22: 29 Jan 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned about `Element.getBoundingClientRect()` method and worked on some css effects  [Tweet Link Here 🐦](https://twitter.com/palashv2/status/825757066669076480)

### Day 23: 5 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:**  "The Voiceinator 5000" challenge was great. Also, learned about SpeechSynthesis interface.

### Day 24: 11 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:** Sticky Nav was really an interesting challenge. Learned about the requirement of padding top in nav element and other UI effects using css.

### Day 25: 11 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:** Learned about `Event.stopPropagation()` & `EventTarget.addEventListener()` boolean options like capture, once & passive. More details about it here: 
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener

### Day 26: 13 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:** It was super-fun learning abt this really slick "follow along" nav found on Stripe's pricing page. [Tweet Link Here 🐦](https://twitter.com/palashv2/status/831161506301612036)

### Day 27: 14 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:** Understood the basics behind the "Click and Drag to Scroll" challenge. element.offsetLeft play a great role in this logic.

**Tip:** Simple & time-saving tip 

![console image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4oivhGVcAApV3E.jpg)

### Day 28: 15 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:** Finished the fantastic video speed controller UI challenge today. These offset properties are pretty important for proper aligments. For block-level elements, `offsetTop`, `offsetLeft`, `offsetWidth`, and `offsetHeight` describe the border box of an element relative to the `offsetParent`. The `offsetParent` element is the nearest ancestor that has a position other than static.

### Day 29: 16 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:** Finished the beeeeeeeeutiful countdown break clock challenge today. Learned about timestamps, set & clear intervals and `Date.now()`. The `Date.now()` method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Because `now()` is a static method of Date, we can always use it as `Date.now()` instead of `new Date().now()`.

### Day 30: 20 Feb 2017
**Thoughts:** Finally finished #JavaScript30 Day 30 Whack A Mole 🔨 challenge. It was fun learning experience. Highly recommend the entire course.
